# Roadmap for Rebuilding the App with Flet

## Objective
Rebuild the Momentum app using Flet as the engine to power the app, ensuring a modern, responsive, and maintainable architecture.

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup
1. **Understand Flet Framework**
   - Research Flet's capabilities and limitations.
   - Identify key features of Flet that align with the app's requirements.

2. **Define Core Features**
   - List all features to be implemented in the app (e.g., navigation, themes, pages).
   - Prioritize features based on user needs.

3. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install Flet and its dependencies.
   - Configure the project structure to align with Flet's best practices.

---

## Phase 2: Core Architecture
1. **Theme Management**
   - Implement a `ThemeFactory` class to manage light and dark themes.
   - Ensure all components dynamically adapt to theme changes.

2. **Navigation System**
   - Build a `NavigationBar` component for bottom navigation.
   - Integrate navigation logic to handle route changes.

3. **Page Management**
   - Create a `PageBuilder` class to dynamically construct pages based on routes.
   - Use a `Page` class to initialize the Flet `ft.Page` object with app-wide settings.

---

## Phase 3: Component Development
1. **Header Component**
   - Build a `Header` class for the app's top bar.
   - Include profile, settings, and theme toggle options.

2. **Page Components**
   - Refactor existing pages (`Home`, `Activities`, `Focus`, `Skills`) into class-based structures.
   - Ensure each page uses the `ThemeFactory` for dynamic styling.

3. **Reusable Widgets**
   - Create a `widgets.py` file for reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards).

---

## Phase 4: Data and Storage
1. **Data Management**
   - Design a data layer to handle user data and app state.
   - Use a `storage` module for persistent data storage.

2. **Temporary Data**
   - Implement a `temp` directory for caching temporary data.

---

## Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all components and pages.
   - Ensure 100% test coverage for critical features.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize Flet components for responsiveness.
   - Minimize resource usage and improve load times.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment
1. **Build and Package**
   - Use Flet's packaging tools to build the app for multiple platforms (e.g., desktop, mobile).

2. **Release**
   - Publish the app to app stores and other distribution platforms.
   - Monitor user feedback and iterate on improvements.

---

## Phase 7: Post-Launch
1. **User Feedback**
   - Collect feedback from users to identify pain points.
   - Plan updates and new features based on feedback.

2. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly update dependencies and libraries.
   - Fix bugs and improve app performance over time.
